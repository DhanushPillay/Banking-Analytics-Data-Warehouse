# Requirement Analysis

To successfully build the data warehouse, the following requirements must be met:

- **Data Integration (ETL):** Extract raw historical banking data (based on the real-world PKDD'99 Financial Dataset), transform it into analytical formats, and load it into a centralized repository.
- **Dimensional Modeling:** The schema must support slicing and dicing across time (dates), geography (branches), and demographics (customers).
- **Metric Calculations:** The system must aggregate total deposits, calculate loan default rates, segment customers by age groups, and track net cash flow.
- **OLAP Capabilities:** The database must support complex analytical functions including `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, and `Drill-down`.
- **Visualization:** A BI dashboard is required to visually represent the analytical queries to end-users without requiring SQL knowledge.
